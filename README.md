# Tor Config

Tor Configuration Example

Configuration examples
for my Exit Node.
to go to `/usr/local/etc/tor/torrc` on Ubuntu. 
Please see `torrc` in this repo.

I do not take any responsibility for problems / insecure
configurations found here, however I did my best to be as
careful as possible.
